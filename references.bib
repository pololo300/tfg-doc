  abstract = {We examined the sequence of decision problems that are encountered
              in the game of Tetris and found that most of the problems are easy
              in the following sense: One can choose well among the available
              actions without knowing an evaluation function that scores well in
              the game. This is a consequence of three conditions that are
              prevalent in the game: simple dominance, cumulative dominance, and
              noncompensation. These conditions can be exploited to develop
              faster and more effective learning algorithms. In addition, they
              allow certain types of domain knowledge to be incorporated with
              ease into a learning algorithm. Among the sequential decision
              problems we encounter, it is unlikely that Tetris is unique or rare
              in having these properties.},
