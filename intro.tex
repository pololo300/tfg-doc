Tetris, created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, .... 


A lot of work has been done around Tetris. In fields such as computer science, it has been studied for its algorithmic complexity, AI applications, and programming education. Studies on human interaction with Tetris explore cognitive processes, social behaviors, and performance factors. Additionally, Tetris has influenced robotics, narrative storytelling, and educational tools, while its theoretical challenges, such as NP-completeness, continue to intrigue researchers \cite{TWRP}.


the question \emph{"what makes Tetris hard?"} or \emph{"where is the complexity in tetris?"}.
