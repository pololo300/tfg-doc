\section*{Abstract}

The computational complexity of Tetris has been extensively studied across various problem formulations and game variations, most of which are classified as NP-hard. This paper explores the fundamental factors contributing to this complexity. We begin by generalizing the Tetris problem, parametrizing its key components to create a unified framework for all variations. Next we examine existing research and identify critical findings about each variant. After the analysis, we focus on a specific variation of Tetris with dominoes, addressing the open problem of survival by demonstrating that it is solvable in polynomial time. In doing so, we provide new insights into the mechanisms driving the complexity of Tetris and its variants. Additionally, we present progress on several other open problems related to Tetris with dominoes, contributing further to the understanding of its computational challenges.
